## MetaData

1. The 780th Military Intelligence Brigade  is investigating a suspected agent of the Donovian government  They are known to have taken the following photo with their phone.

    Help us identify the manufacturer, model, and serial number of their phone to aid in the investigation.
    
    Tools:
    - exiftool

    (Student provides requested metadata)


2. Using the information you provided we were able to match the camera used in the previous image to photos posted on an anonymous darkweb forum.  Examine the metadata of this  
image and see if you can confirm the location it was taken from.
(Student uses GPS coordinates to look up location on google maps)

## Geolocation

Excellent!  With your location you provided we were able to apprehend the operative and obtain their phone.  The phone contained additional photos that may help us identify the target of thier attack.

Challenge: "Become a Cyber Detective - Trace the IP Addresses!"

Objective: Introduce students to the concept of IP addresses and teach them how to use online tools to trace the approximate geographic location of an IP address.

Materials Needed:

    A list of 5-10 IP addresses (obtain these from public sources or use examples from your network).
    Access to the internet and computers for each student.

Instructions:

    Begin by explaining what an IP address is and why it's important in the context of cybersecurity. Discuss the difference between IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

    Show students how to find the IP address of their own device. They can visit websites like "WhatIsMyIP.com" to see their current IP address.

    Present the list of IP addresses you've provided. These can be a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

    Instruct students to use online IP geolocation tools to trace the approximate geographic location of each IP address. A popular tool for this purpose is "ipinfo.io."

    Have students record their findings for each IP address. They should include the country, city (if available), and any additional information provided by the geolocation tool.

    Encourage students to discuss any patterns they notice. For example, do they see any IP addresses from different countries? Are there any IP addresses from their own region?

    Discuss the limitations of IP geolocation. Explain that while it can provide approximate location information, it may not always be entirely accurate, and IP addresses can be masked or routed through different locations.

    Emphasize the importance of using this information responsibly and ethically and discuss the potential privacy and security implications of sharing or revealing one's own IP address.

    As an extension activity, you can ask students to research how IP geolocation is used in real-world scenarios, such as for targeted advertising or cybersecurity purposes.

This challenge helps middle schoolers gain a basic understanding of IP addresses and geolocation, all while promoting awareness of online privacy and responsible use of this information.
