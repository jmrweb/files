# Reporting

## Consider the Objective

Take into account the objective of the assessment. What did you set out to accomplish? Is there a single, specific statement you hope to make in the report? Many inexperienced penetration testers get caught up in the technical aspects of an assessment and the skills necessary to pull them off, but a penetration test is never an opportunity to simply show off. Keep the initial objective in mind as you begin writing the report.

Organize your content to build a report that will resonate the most with your audience. We highly recommend writing an outline before starting. You can do this quickly and easily by creating section headers, without the actual content or explanation. This will help you avoid repeating yourself or leaving out critical information. It can also help you more easily get past the dreaded "writer's block".

## Consider the Audience

Think about who will be reading and acting on the information you've included in the report. What does your audience hope to learn from it? Who are they? In most cases, people with vastly different levels of technical knowledge will read your report. Try to write something to satisfy each potential reader of the report. Practically speaking, this means writing your report in sections that address the needs of different audiences.

Let's spend a moment talking a bit more about the audience.

You might expect high-level executives in a company to read some parts of the report. In most cases these executives do not have the time or desire to read all of the highly technical details of the attack. For this reason, most reports start with an Executive Summary. The Executive Summary should be a short (no more than two pages), high-level explanation of the results and the client's overall security posture. Since it is likely the only part they will ever read, make sure you tailor this section and the language for the executives specifically.

There will also be a team of more technical professionals who will read your report in greater detail. The rest of the report should cater to them, and will include all the gory details of the carnage you inflicted upon the target network.

## Consider What to Include

More specifically, it's helpful to think about what not to include. Keep in mind that your readers will want to address the issues you discovered, so all the content that you include should be relevant and meaningful. A bloated report with too much tangential or irrelevant information just makes reading and understanding difficult for your audience. Don't include filler material just to make the report look longer.

Here are four quick pointers on what to include and what to leave out:

  1. DO NOT include pages and pages of a tool output in your report unless it is absolutely relevant. Consider Nmap's output. There is no reason for you to include every single line from the output in your report as it does not add anything of value. If you have a point that you are trying to make, for example a very high number of SNMP services exposed on publicly accessible hosts, then use the â€“oG flag and grep out only those hosts with open SNMP ports.

  2. Make use of screenshots wisely. The same rule applies as with the rest of the content you add to your report. Use a screenshot to make a point, not just to show awesome meterpreter output. For example, say you got root on a Linux host. Rather than displaying 15 screenshots of various directory listings only a root user could access, just include a single screenshot of the whoami command output. A technically savvy reader may only need this one thing to understand what you have achieved.

  3. Include extra materials as additional supporting documents. If you have content that will drive up the page count but not be interesting to your entire audience, consider providing additional supporting documents in addition to the report. The readers who need this information can still inspect the supporting documentation and the quality of the report won't suffer.

  4. Perhaps most importantly, refer back to the objective of the assessment. Think about the point you are trying to make as it relates to the objective and about how each piece of information will or will not reinforce that point.

## Consider the Presentation

The presentation of content is just as critical as the content itself. More than anything, a command of language is absolutely crucial. While we understand that for many of our students, English is not their native language, it is still important to try to write coherent sentences that flow smoothly and logically. In this case, it is important to "Try Harder" and do your best, focusing on making points that are simple and easy to understand.

Additionally, you may want to keep the following in mind:

  1. Be consistent. Watch out for inconsistencies in things like spacing, heading styles, font selection, and so on. Misaligned and inconsistent paragraphs or titles look unprofessional and sloppy.

  2. Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck! This one is pretty self-explanatory. Their != There, Your != You're

These pointers should give you a general idea of how to write a professional-looking and coherent report that clearly delivers the intended message. Ultimately, the report is the product you are delivering to the client. Make sure it represents you and your work properly and professionally.
